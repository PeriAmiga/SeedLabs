    <h1>Security Labs in Ubuntu OS</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This repository contains documentation and solutions for a series of security labs conducted on Ubuntu operating system. The labs covered various topics including sniffing and spoofing, ARP attacks, IP attacks, local and remote DNS vulnerabilities, and manipulation of firewalls. Each lab aimed to provide hands-on experience with fundamental concepts in network security and system hardening.</p>
