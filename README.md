Security Labs in Ubuntu OS
Overview
This repository contains documentation and solutions for a series of security labs conducted on Ubuntu operating system. The labs covered various topics including sniffing and spoofing, ARP attacks, IP attacks, local and remote DNS vulnerabilities, and manipulation of firewalls. Each lab aimed to provide hands-on experience with fundamental concepts in network security and system hardening.

Labs Completed
1. Sniffing and Spoofing
Description: This lab focused on understanding network traffic interception techniques through sniffing and spoofing.
Tools Used: Wireshark, Scapy
Learning Outcomes: Identification of network vulnerabilities, understanding of packet manipulation techniques.
2. ARP Attacks
Description: This lab explored Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) vulnerabilities and techniques for ARP spoofing.
Tools Used: arpspoof, ettercap
Learning Outcomes: Understanding ARP poisoning, mitigation strategies for ARP attacks.
3. IP Attacks
Description: This lab delved into various IP-based attacks such as IP spoofing, TCP hijacking, and ICMP attacks.
Tools Used: hping3, netwox
Learning Outcomes: Recognizing IP-based vulnerabilities, practical experience with network packet crafting.
4. Local and Remote DNS
Description: This lab investigated DNS-related vulnerabilities both at local and remote levels, including cache poisoning and DNS tunneling.
Tools Used: dnsspoof, dnscat2
Learning Outcomes: Understanding DNS protocol weaknesses, implementing secure DNS configurations.
5. Firewall Manipulation
Description: This lab focused on manipulating firewall rules to understand ingress and egress filtering, as well as bypassing firewall restrictions.
Tools Used: iptables, nmap
Learning Outcomes: Practical experience with firewall configurations, identification of firewall evasion techniques.

Usage
